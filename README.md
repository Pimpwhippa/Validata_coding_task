1.initialization of Azure SQL Server can be done by following the instructions in this link
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?view=azuresql-db&source=recommendations&tabs=azure-portal

copy your ODBC connection string and your password to connect to it. The connection string looks like this

Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:yourservername.database.windows.net,1433;Database=YourDatabasename;Uid=azureuser;Pwd={your_password_here};Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=no;Connection Timeout=30;

Also add your IP address in the allow list

2.instructions on how to set up and run the application, including any necessary dependencies or libraries

first make sure you have ODBC Driver 18 installed in your machine

git clone

cd 'Part 1 Create Flask CRUD app for Microsoft SQL Server'

create credentials.py and put your connection string and your password in conn_str variable like this 

conn_str =f"Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:yourservername.database.windows.net,1433;Database=YourDatabasename;Uid=azureuser;Pwd={your_password_here};Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=no;Connection Timeout=30;"

virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

export FLASK_APP=app.py

flask run



Now the app should work with these available routes

/create

/banks (list all banks)

/banks/<int:bank_id> (view a bankâ€™s details)

/updatebank

/deletebank/<int:bank_id>




For Part 2
